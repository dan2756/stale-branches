# stale-branches

List and delete old or merged git branches.

`stale-branches` shows your stale branches with the age of their last commit,
the last author, whether they are already merged into the base branch, and
how far ahead and behind the base they are, so you can see at a glance what
is safe to clean up. Then it deletes them for you, locally or on the remote,
without ever touching the branches you care about.

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/dan2756/stale-branches@latest
```

## Usage

Run it anywhere inside a git repository:

```console
$ stale-branches
BRANCH          AGE           AUTHOR  STATUS    AHEAD  BEHIND
spike/parser    7 months ago  Alice   unmerged      4      58
feature/login   4 months ago  Bob     merged        0      31
fix/typo        2 days ago    Alice   merged        0       2
```

A branch is **stale** when it is merged into the base branch or its last
commit is more than 90 days old. `--all` lists every branch instead.
Branches are listed oldest first. `AHEAD` counts commits only on the branch,
`BEHIND` counts commits only on the base.

The base branch is the target of `origin/HEAD` (unless that branch no longer
exists, as after the remote renamed `master` to `main`), else `main`, else
`master`. Use `--base develop` to compare against something else. The local
branch is preferred when it exists; `--base origin/main` compares against the
remote-tracking branch instead, which is handy when your local `main` is
behind. `--base HEAD` compares against the commit you have checked out.

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--base BRANCH` | branch to compare against |
| `--remote` | list the remote's branches instead of local ones |
| `--remote-name NAME` | remote for `--remote` and base detection (default `origin`) |
| `--all` | list every branch, not just stale ones |
| `--merged` | only branches merged into the base |
| `--unmerged` | only branches not merged into the base |
| `--older-than AGE` | only branches whose last commit is older than `AGE` |
| `--author REGEX` | only branches whose last commit author matches (against `Name <email>`) |
| `--pattern GLOB` | only branches matching `GLOB`; repeat for several |
| `--squash` | also treat squash- and rebase-merged branches as merged |
| `--protect LIST` | comma-separated globs of branches never to touch |
| `--delete` | delete the listed branches after asking `[y/N]` |
| `-y`, `--yes` | don't ask (required when stdin is not a terminal) |
| `--force` | also delete unmerged branches (`git branch -D`) |
| `-n`, `--dry-run` | print the git commands `--delete` would run |
| `--json` | print JSON instead of a table |
| `--porcelain` | print only branch names, one per line |
| `-C DIR` | run as if started in `DIR` |
| `-h`, `--help` | show help |
| `--version` | print the version |

`--merged`, `--unmerged` and `--older-than` replace the default stale rule and
are combined with AND, so `--unmerged --older-than 6mo` finds abandoned work.
Ages are a number followed by `h`, `d`, `w`, `mo` (30 days) or `y` (365 days):
`90d`, `6w`, `3mo`, `1y`, up to about 292 years.

`--author` and `--pattern` always narrow the result further. `--author` uses
Go regexp syntax (prefix with `(?i)` for case-insensitive). Wrap literal text
in `\Q...\E`: in an address such as `12345+me@users.noreply.github.com` the
`+` and `.` would otherwise be read as regexp operators. In `--pattern`, `*`
also matches `/`, so `feature/*` covers `feature/auth/login` too.

## Examples

```sh
# What would a cleanup delete? Run it from the base branch.
stale-branches --dry-run

# Delete merged branches without prompting, e.g. from a script.
stale-branches --merged --delete -y

# Your own abandoned work.
stale-branches --unmerged --older-than 6mo --author "\Q$(git config user.email)\E"

# Everything on origin that was squash-merged through pull requests.
git fetch --prune
stale-branches --remote --squash --merged

# Compare against origin/main without pulling first.
stale-branches --base origin/main

# Feed branch names to other tools.
stale-branches --porcelain --merged | xargs -n1 git log -1 --format='%h %an %s'

# Unmerged branches that carry real work, via jq.
stale-branches --json --unmerged | jq -r '.branches[] | select(.ahead > 3) | .name'
```

## Output

The table is colored when stdout is a terminal; set `NO_COLOR` to turn that
off. For scripts there are two stable formats, which are never colored:

```console
$ stale-branches --porcelain --merged
feature/login
fix/typo

$ stale-branches --json --pattern 'feature/*'
{
  "base": "main",
  "branches": [
    {
      "name": "feature/login",
      "ref": "refs/heads/feature/login",
      "commit": "3f9c2e1d6b0a4c8e9f7a2b1c0d9e8f7a6b5c4d3e",
      "date": "2026-06-08T09:12:44Z",
      "age_days": 133,
      "author": "Bob",
      "email": "bob@example.com",
      "status": "merged",
      "merged": true,
      "squashed": false,
      "ahead": 0,
      "behind": 31,
      "current": false,
      "protected": false
    }
  ]
}
```

`status` is `merged`, `unmerged` or (with `--squash`) `squashed`. `note` is
added for protected branches (shown with `--all`) and says why:
`current`, `worktree`, `base` or `protected`. With `--remote` the object also
has `"remote": "origin"` and `base` is the remote-tracking branch, e.g.
`origin/main`. With `--delete`, the same formats describe what is about to be
deleted (an empty list when nothing is), and git's own messages go to stderr.

## Deleting

`--delete` shows the branches it is about to delete and asks before doing
anything. Without a terminal on stdin it refuses unless you pass `-y`.

```console
$ stale-branches --delete
skipping spike/parser: not merged into main (use --force to delete it)
BRANCH         AGE           AUTHOR  STATUS  AHEAD  BEHIND
feature/login  4 months ago  Bob     merged      0      31
fix/typo       2 days ago    Alice   merged      0       2
Delete 2 branches? [y/N] y
Deleted branch feature/login (was 3f9c2e1).
Deleted branch fix/typo (was 81d07aa).
```

Only merged branches are deleted, with `git branch -d`. `--force` deletes
unmerged ones too, with `git branch -D`. `--dry-run` prints the exact
command instead of running it:

```console
$ stale-branches --dry-run --force
git branch -D spike/parser feature/login fix/typo
```

`git branch -d` checks merges against `HEAD` (or the branch's upstream), not
the base branch, so run deletions from the base branch.

## Squash and rebase merges

If your project merges pull requests with "squash and merge" or "rebase and
merge", the branch tips never become ancestors of the base, so they look
unmerged. `--squash` adds two checks for every unmerged branch and reports a
match as `squashed`:

1. **Rebased or cherry-picked:** `git cherry <base> <branch>` marks every
   commit of the branch as already upstream.
2. **Squashed:** a throwaway commit is built with the branch's tree on top of
   its merge base (`git commit-tree <branch>^{tree} -p <merge-base>`), which
   is what a squash merge of the branch would look like, and `git cherry`
   checks whether the base already has a commit with the same patch.

This is a heuristic. It misses squash merges whose diff differs from the
branch's, for example when conflicts were resolved during the merge or the
branch got more commits afterwards. A branch with no net change against its
merge base (only empty commits, or a change and its revert) is never reported
as `squashed`, since its empty patch would match any empty commit on the
base. The probe commit is never referenced by anything and is cleaned up by
`git gc`; it has a fixed author and date, so repeated runs reuse the same
object. Expect it to be slower on repositories with many branches.

Squashed branches count as merged for the stale rule and `--merged`, but
`git branch -d` cannot see that, so deleting them needs `--force`:

```console
$ stale-branches --squash --merged --delete --force
```

## Remote branches

`--remote` looks at `refs/remotes/origin/*` instead of your local branches and
compares them against `origin/main` (or whatever `origin/HEAD` points to).
Only refs that the remote's fetch refspecs (`remote.origin.fetch`) map from a
branch of the same name count; others, such as pull requests fetched with
`+refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*`, are left out.
Fetch first so the remote-tracking refs are current:

```console
$ git fetch --prune
$ stale-branches --remote --merged
BRANCH         AGE           AUTHOR  STATUS  AHEAD  BEHIND
feature/login  4 months ago  Bob     merged      0      31
dependabot/x   3 weeks ago   bot     merged      0       9

$ stale-branches --remote --merged --dry-run
git push origin --delete feature/login dependabot/x
```

Remote deletions go out in a single `git push <remote> --delete`. The remote
branch matching your current branch (by name or as its upstream) is protected
like the current branch is locally. Use `--remote-name upstream` for a
different remote; it also picks which `<remote>/HEAD` is used to detect the
base.

## Protected branches

The current branch, branches checked out in another worktree (`git worktree`)
and the base branch are always protected. On top of that, branches matching
`main,master,develop,release/*` are protected by default. Protected branches
never show up as stale and are never deleted, whatever the filters say;
`--all` lists them with a `NOTE` saying why.

Replace the default list per repository (or globally with `--global`):

```sh
git config stale-branches.protect 'main,develop,release/*,hotfix/*'
```

The key may be given several times (`git config --add`), and each value may
hold several comma-separated globs. `--protect` on the command line overrides
both; `--protect ''` leaves only the always-protected branches.

## Configuration

| Setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `git config stale-branches.protect` | protected branch globs (see above) |
| `NO_COLOR` | any non-empty value disables color |
| `TERM=dumb` | disables color |

## Exit status

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | success, including "no matching branches" and a declined prompt |
| 1 | git error, not a git repository, or a deletion that git refused |
| 2 | usage error, or `--delete` without `-y` when stdin is not a terminal |

## Platform notes

Works on Linux and macOS. It shells out to `git`, which must be on `PATH`;
git 2.23 or newer is needed (for worktree detection).
